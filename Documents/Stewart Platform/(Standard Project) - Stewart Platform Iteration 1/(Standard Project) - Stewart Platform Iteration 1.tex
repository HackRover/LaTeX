\section{Mechanical Design}
The goal being established is to the end of making the basic mechanical model of the Stewart platform. 

	\subsection{4/5/23}
		\subsubsection{Summary}
		Today was mostly research of the Stewart platform with some basic design. I found out that all Stewart platforms are termed rigid machines meaning their inverse kinematics solutions are significantly easier than forward. This means if we know the final position of the platform the math to determine angles of the actuators is easier than if we knew the angles of actuators and wanted the output. Study robotic kinematics further to understand these concepts. You may use either linear or rotary actuators, but the math will differ. The references and resources section contains some good examples and someone has done the math for control. Stewart platforms also use joint ends which are universal or spherical, this prevents the response and drive platforms from binding on each other and makes the math model simpler. 
		
		Some early design decisions that are more than obvious is the use of spherical joints, I believe I've found some cheap ones online. Further, a long horn on the driving servos will be chosen to maximize the travel of the driven platform; draw this out if you're confused: a platform where stub horns vs long horns are used. I'm also pretty confident I'll be using two triangular platforms which overlap like David's Star, with the driven triangle transitioning into a circular 'cage' housing for the LiDAR.

		The first version of the eye will probably just be for practice controls and mechanical effectiveness. The first and final will share the same motors, joints, and most mounting; however, the final will include additional mounting for fixture to the rover, improved linkages, and additional components to make the whole assembly water/rubble resistant. 
		
	\subsection{4/6/23}
		\subsubsection{Summary}
		Continued research into the design of the Stewart platform. Notes on many of the design projects and research papers were completed in the 'Scratch Notes' document found in the drive. Perhaps in the future some notes summarizing the math and theory behind Stewart platforms can be written.
	
	\subsection{4/7/23}
		\subsubsection{Summary}
		Continued research, like yesterday. Some part selection and purchasing based on my current knowledge. Didn't purchase ball joint linkages, but instead came up with a method of grabbing the 3D file desired from McMaster-Carr and printing; see an explanation below.
		
		\subsubsection{Roadblock: Horrible Prices...}
		In the design of the Stewart platform some threaded ball joint linkages were needed. Note that ball joint linkages and ball joints are different in that the former has a linkage built into the ball of the joint. When I tried to purchase these online I saw prices of \textbf{\$ 18.00 each}... and I need 12 of these minimum. Obviously this won't do, and plastic hobby ones found for resale on Ebay appear incredibly sketchy.
		
		Instead, I pick the ball joint linkage size I desire from McMaster-Carr, then press `download 3D model', (make sure it's set to download the STEP file). From there I can model with the STEP in Fusion360, or use an online, free converted to convert to STL, then print it. For things like ball joint linkages I strongly encourage you to use a resin printer, since it can print high resolution and threads pretty well.

		\end{figure}
		
		When modeling with STEP files in Fusion360, it's advised to make slight modifications and redesigns for the purpose of 3D printing. Make sure to save both a Fusion360 part file and an STL version. If I do this with the ball joint linkages I'll detail and snapshot how I edited them.

\section{Electrical Design}
	\subsection{4/5/23}
		\subsubsection{Summary}
		Today some work was done in the way of planning the electrical; however, it relies all on existing knowledge of electronics. I may do more research in the future to ensure the the electrical is robust and end up changing the plans. Currently a solderable GikFun board will be used to provide all power and convey signal. Additionally, an Arduino Mega will be used for direct control of servos, but will recieve its instructions from the Nano. 
		
		Pins 2-7 on the Mega will convey logic through the GikFun board to the 6 movement servos, while pipns 10-11 will convey logic to the 'eyelids' of the protective housing. The GikFun will have a 5V barell jack that will recieve power from the PCB PDS of the rover. The Mega will recieve power from the GikFun, also a barell jack. The Mega will also be connected to the Nano via a standard USB printer cable. The Mega and Nano will communicate through ROS. An image below of the rough schematic can be seen.

	\subsection{4/7/23}
		\subsubsection{Summary}
		Some thought worth noting was put into the electrical. A 3D model of the complete circuit will be completed, and then a housing created. The printable housing will act as a sort of 'guide' for soldering components. 
		
		Because of it's superior clock speed, RAM, and electronics, we'll be opting to use the Arduino Due over the Mega. The Due has the exact same footprint as the Mega so nothing will change in the schematics.
