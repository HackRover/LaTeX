\section*{Status Update}
%%This section should include content like: what is the status of the major projects, what major/noteworthy events have occured in the previous week, and any changes made to the expectations of capstone, etc.



\section*{What's been done since last week?}
%%This section focuses on actual stuff that's been accomplished on specific projects since the previous week; make sure you note what has been missed.
	\subsection*{Project 1: Stewart Platform}
	Stewart platform is built. Ready for iteration 2.
		
	\subsection*{Project 2: Mechanical for Rover}
	Previous rover parts are disassembled. CAD models are being made.
	
	\subsection*{Project 3: Electrical for Motor/Motor Controllers}
	
		
	\subsection*{Project 4: Rover PDS}	
	Buck modules are good and ready to be used. PCB is ready to be printed.
		
	\subsection*{Project 5: Puzzle Panel PDS}
	PCB for puzzle panel PDS is ready to be printed.
		
	\subsection*{Project 6: Software for Rover}
	Website is made for next week. Skeleton codes for motor/motor controllers are finished and ready to be tested.
		
	\subsection*{Project 7: Image Processing}
	Little progress made. Need power supply for the Nano. Been working on connecting the camera to the Xavier. Will port the software over to Nano once power supply arrives.
	
	\subsection*{Project 8: Inventory}
	About 90\% of old rover is torn down and inventoried.	
\section*{What's the plan for next week?}
%%Should provide not only the deliverables for the next week, but also some rationale for those deliverables.
	\subsection*{Project 1: Stewart Platform}
	Building the first iteration of the Stewart platform. Will begin on iteration 2.
	
	\subsection*{Project 2: Mechanical for Rover}
	Designing Fusion 360 model for Mimir
	
	\subsection*{Project 3: Electrical for Motor/Motor Controllers}	
	Testing motors serially now
	
	\subsection*{Project 4: Rover PDS}	
	Ordering PCB
		
	\subsection*{Project 5: Puzzle Panel PDS}
	Working on iteration 2: PCB instead of the Gikfun boards
	
	\subsection*{Project 6: Software for Rover}
	Skeleton nodes are already done. Moving to working on software for existing iteration 1 of the Stewart platform for now.
		
	\subsection*{Project 7: Image Processing}
	Will need to finish up the 2D object detection by next week
